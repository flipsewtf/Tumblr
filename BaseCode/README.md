# A Rich, jQuery-Free Tumblr Basecode Template

For a long time, most theme-makers relied on jQuery because Tumblr scripts required it. But now, you can build a fully functional theme **without jQuery**. This basecode is designed to help you do just that.

Accessibility (a11y) is always evolving, but I‚Äôve done my best to make this basecode as accessible as possible. I hope you find it useful - the internet is for everyone!

## Features & Notes

This basecode includes examples of:

-   Slide-down toggle menus
-   Hiding Tumblr controls behind icons
-   Update tabs
-   Tag toggles
-   Dark mode toggle
-   Shortened note counts

It uses:

-   **CSS Variables** ‚Äî especially for light/dark mode and consistent spacing
-   **Tippy.js** ‚Äî for accessible tooltips
-   **Phosphor Icons** ‚Äî as examples for custom like/reblog icons, update tab, etc.

The code is **very** heavily commented. It may be verbose, but it‚Äôs meant to help you understand how everything works. Using Chrome DevTools or Firefox Inspector is recommended to explore the structure, classes, and functionality.

## Suggestions & Help

If you want a jQuery-free version of [@bychloethemes‚Äôs Timeago plugin](https://bychloethemes.tumblr.com/plugins/timeago), I wrote one [here](https://github.com/flipsewtf/TimeAgo).

Pure JavaScript isn‚Äôt harder than jQuery ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a few extra lines. The benefit? You **don‚Äôt need to load an entire library** for simple tasks like a navigation toggle üòÅ
